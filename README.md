# detector_lines a table for detector lines

heh.  so self-descriptive.

And yet, not so much.  The table detector_lines used to hold
approximations of lines, from one detector location to the next using
milepost or equivalent as the way to order them.  But then I added WIM
sites to the mix, so the lines went away.

The table holds detectors and point geometry collections, grouped by
the freeway number (called refnum) and the direction.
